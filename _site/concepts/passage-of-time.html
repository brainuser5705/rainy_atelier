<h2>Process</h2>


    <img src="/artwork/concepts/passage-of-time/img3.jpg">


<p>The goal of this design was to show a character and their different designs during three different stages of their lives. I wanted to explore different types of psychopomps/spirit guides and how they would change throughout their lives despite being supernatural and immortal.</p>

<p>The character I settled on is a shepherdess named Alaska. She was a human, but after her death, she becomes a lost soul in the form of a sheep, her spirit animal. I liked the idea that her character guided sheep in her human life, and in the afterlife, she guides spirits. Therefore, after she becomes a spirit guide, she meets an injured wolf spirit: the common enemy of her sheep in her past life. Though they had a rocky first encounter, she learns to forgive Lupin the wolf and they become friends.</p>
