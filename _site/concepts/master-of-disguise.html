<h2>Process</h2>


    <img src="/artwork/concepts/master-of-disguise/img3.png">


<p>The goal of this project was to show a single character’s multiple disguises. The brainstorming process of this project, in the beginning, was mostly in my head as I thought of multiple archetypes that would need a disguise: assassins, spies, espionage, detectives, and raccoons as thieves. I kept on coming back to the idea of a magical girl that has to hide her identity from her friends and family.</p>

<p>I learned recently that Marie Antionette would turn her husband’s clock forward to trick him into going to sleep earlier so that she could sneak out to go to parties. I really latched onto this mischievous personality of hers.
In my version of Marie Antionette, she’s still expected to be a good queen but doesn’t allow others to know about her frivolous tendencies, such as spending money and going to parties. The first design is her “mature queen disguise” she puts on for others. In her second design, she’s wearing a chemise a la reine (very scandalous as it resembled underwear at the time). She uses this disguise to escape from the duties and pressures of being a queen by imagining a simpler life in her rustic cottage retreat. Finally, her third design is her magical fairy godmother disguise that she also uses to attend parties. As someone that loved both children and parties, I thought it was fitting for her to be a fairy godmother that sends children to parties.</p>

<p>Hopefully, with all these disguises, she can escape a beheading this time. 
Of course, her mode of transportation needs to be just as extravagant as she is. Her love of chocolate and sweets resulted in the creation of this candy carriage pulled by a giant candy corn mouse.</p>
